# Swapi-Box

## Abstract:

As a solo project, I leveraged the Star Wars API to create modular code with the use of lifecyle methods and expanded upon React muscle memory. When the user first accesses the page, there is a random film that scrolls on the page and the user can select from 'people', 'planets', and 'vehicles' to display more information for each respective button.

## Setup:

First, clone down the repo.

```bash
git clone 
```

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
To run tests in the game program, Run:
```bash
npm test
```
